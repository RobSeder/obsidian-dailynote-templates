Daily Note templates for Obsidian.

> [!NOTE] 
> This This repository is for users of Obsidian, the notes platform, and is very specific to only Obsidian!

This is a very niche repository of code. This is specifically for someone who:

- Uses [Obsidian](https://www.obsidian.md) for note-taking (a competitor for Notion)
  - Uses the [Daily Notes](https://help.obsidian.md/Plugins/Daily+notes) built-in plug-in, which creates a page for you to add notes/tasks/etc for each calendar day
    - Uses the [Templater](https://github.com/SilentVoid13/Templater) plug-in, which allows you to make templates that execute code when a page is created.
      - (Optionally) Uses the [Meta Bind](https://github.com/mProjectsCode/obsidian-meta-bind-plugin) plug-in to have the ability to add buttons and other UI fields. In this case, we have a button that "pushes" unfinished tasks to the current Daily Note, to "carry forward" those tasks, so that they don't fall through the cracks.

So, if this describes you? You are in LUCK!! :shamrock:

See the inner [README.md](src/README.md) for details about the templates and scripts in this repo.
